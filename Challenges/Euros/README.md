## ECSC 2016

This was the first *major* CTF challenge that I had solved at the time.

Having just turned 18 at the start of my Bachelor studies, the Irish cyber security team brought back a cryptographic challenge from the first edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge ([ecsc.eu](https://ecsc.eu)) in October of 2016.

The task was first exhibited at an Ethical Hacker Society meeting on campus some time in November. All of the necessary files were posted in a closed Facebook group, which I could not access without an account. Luckily, a kind soul named Dean O'Neill forwarded them to me privately. Neither of us were sure I could do it, but, in short, I spent a weekend and a half reading page after page about RSA to understand how it works, slowly piecing everything together until... I arrived at a [solution](https://github.com/victorazzam/stash/blob/master/Challenges/Euros/solution_euros_9-12-16.pdf).

The task was complete and in the next meeting I received a free USB flash drive as a prize. Boy that felt great! Now I was sure I could achieve **aNyThInG** if I put my mind to it.
